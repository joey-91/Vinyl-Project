## Predicting Vinyl Record Prices

This project aims to build the best possible model for predicting record prices, given all the potential predictors I could find on Discogs.com

## Motivation

This was the final project of my General Assembly Data Science Immersive course. I wanted to build something a little more interesting than the datasets available on Kaggle, and a tool I could potentially use for myself.

## Methodology

### Scraping the data.
  This was the most labour intensive part of the project. Using a combination of Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Regex, to extract and clean the data from it's HTML     format to a structured table. Firstly scraping the ~30,000 most recent records from the search page
